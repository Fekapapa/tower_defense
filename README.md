# Experimental Tower Defense Game
This is an Experimental HTML 5 tower defense game based on the famous browser game Kingdom Rush: Frontiers made by Ironhide Studios.

The original game is one of the best tower defense game ever made played by ten millions of people around the world. This is why I have chosen this game as the object of my experiment.

About the experiment
My experiment's goal is to achieve a game logic and user experience as close as possible to the original game but written in HTML 5 instead of ActionScript (Flash). While Flash palyer is a plug-in it needs to be downloaded to play Flash games on the browser, the HTML 5 based game can be played on any modern browser without any required plug-in or download. This makes easier to reach peaople on the web and is more safe and comfortable to use it. I am a frontend developer and this experiment is a great practise for me and a great challenge for my skills.

About the game's technology
As I mentioned this is an HTML 5 game. SASS used to reach a better readable stylesheet. The game logic is written in vanilla Javascript supported by Redux. I choosed Redux because this is a very powerful tool for the Flux programming pattern in Javascript and this helps a lot to develop a game's logic.

About the Copyright
I don't own any copyright of the original game. This is just an experiment and all of the Copyright is owned by the owner of the original game Kingdom Rush: Frontiers. Because of this every credit goes for them. My experiment don't achieve to earn any credit. This is just a software developing experiment.

I highly recommend you to try the original game beacause that game is a verybest among the tower defense browser games.
